Problem Statement: Customer segmentation is an important technique for developing marketing strategies. It helps in better targeting and positioning customers with the company's offerings. We can perform customer personality analysis by observing their demographics and preferences.
A detailed analysis of a company's preferred customers is known as a customer personality analysis. It enables a company to better understand its customers and makes it easier to modify products or services to meet the specific needs, behaviors, and demands of several types of customers.
Instead of spending money marketing a new product to every customer in a company's database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only to that specific segment.
